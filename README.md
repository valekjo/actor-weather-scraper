# My beautiful actor

The `README.md` file contains a documentation what your actor does and how to use it,
which is then displayed in the app or Apify Store. It's always a good
idea to write a good `README.md`, in a few months not even you
will remember all the details about the actor.

You can use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet)
language for rich formatting.

## Dev Notes

All places available on weather.com are identified by placeId.

Url for respective weather pages is then `https://weather.com/${locale}/weather/{today|hourbyhour|tenday|weekend|monthly}/l/${placeId}`


 - Location might be used instead of trying to set measurement units in cookies:

   - `en-US`, `en-UK` for `F`, `C` respectively


 - finding location ids for address / zip / etc can be done using:

```
 curl 'https://weather.com/api/v1/p/redux-dal' \
>   -H 'content-type: application/json' \
>   --data-binary '[{"name":"getSunV3LocationSearchUrlConfig","params":{"query":"11000","language":"cs-CZ","locationType":"locale"}}]' \
>   --compressed
```

Algorithm:

1. Get all relevant placeIds by:
  - parsing them from startUrls
  - search for them by query (city, zip)

2. Construct urls for combination of placeId, time frame and units



### Problems

Switching between metric and imperial units happens through cookies - but the desired result can be achieved by accessing page with specific locale (but how about cookies? are the same cookies used all the time in the crawler?) - does not matter - whole crawl uses the same minutes.

Zip code, state, etc. are not present in the page code. However, they can be obtained through page search (which is already used to search for places by name.) so we can use the same to obtain more details.


### TODO

 1. input validation
 2. error handling
 3. specific page handlers
 4. tests
 5. output cleanup
 6. readme, license, etc
